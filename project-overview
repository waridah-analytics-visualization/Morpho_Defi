Objective
>Monitor lending flows and surface on-chain BD opportunities for modular DeFi lending protocols like Morpho. Track protocol health, asset utilization, and cohort retention to inform partnerships and incentive design.

Methodology
>Data Sources: Dune Analytics, DefiLlama, TokenTerminal, Morpho governance forums

>Analysis Stack: Python for data manipulation, screenshot-based dashboards for rapid iteration

>Metrics Tracked: TVL trends, borrow/supply ratios, user cohorts

Key Deliverables
>Daily BD Signals: High-value wallet movements and partnership opportunities

>Weekly Dashboard: Protocol health metrics (asset utilization, chain growth, incentive ROI)

>Deep-Dive Analysis: Vertical-specific opportunities (LSTs, stablecoins, RWAs)

Why This Approach
>Global regulatory compliance + Policy Advisory + AI Governance → On-Chain BD

>Regulatory lens: Identify institutional blockers (custody, compliance requirements)

>Governance fluency: Forecast capital movements by monitoring DAO proposals 2-4 weeks pre-execution

>Forensics background: Surface wallet relationships and flow patterns invisible in standard dashboards

>> My previous experience in fintech data analysis, payments/virtual assets compliance, and AI governance reporting enables rigorous cadence for institutional DeFi partnerships.

Sample Insights
Daily Signal Example (Jan 7, 2026)
- Base chain TVL +8% week-over-week (DefiLlama data)
  → Opportunity: Expand vault offerings for L2-native protocols

- Top 5 borrowers increased positions by average 15% (Dune analysis)
  → Action: Outreach for co-designed vault products

- Gauntlet risk parameter discussions in governance
  → Insight: Anticipate market cap adjustments for BD planning
  
- Utilization Rate Framework
> By overlaying borrow and supply trends across specific time periods, we calculate:

> Utilization Rate = Cumulated Borrow USD / Cumulated Supply USD
Example: Dec 15-21, 2024 → 78% utilization (strong capital efficiency signal)

Tools & Resources
- Data Collection 
> Dune Analytics - On-chain SQL queries and dashboards

> DefiLlama - Protocol TVL and competitive analysis

- Research Sources
> Morpho Forum - Governance discussions

> Morpho Blog - Partnership announcements

> Dune Community Dashboards - User-generated analytics

- Notes on Methodology
> Data Authenticity: All charts and metrics sourced from live protocols (Morpho, via Dune/DefiLlama). Cohort analysis demonstrates analytical framework—production version would require direct wallet tracking via Dune queries or Nansen integration. The aforementioned sample insights are examples and not sources from live protocols.

> Timeframe: Analysis covers April 2024 - January 2026 period based on available dashboard data.

> Scope: Single protocol (Morpho) deep-dive to demonstrate domain-specific expertise vs broad multi-protocol survey.

Caption below image:
"Morpho Protocol Total Value Locked - 21-month trend showing protocol growth and capital inflows across all chains."
One-line note:
"TVL peaked at $XXM in [month], indicating strong institutional confidence during [market condition]."

Chart 2: Borrow & Supply Trends (Utilization Framework)

"Utilization Rate Framework: Borrow/Supply ratio calculated across time periods to identify capital efficiency patterns."
Box with example calculation:
Example Calculation:
Dec 15-21, 2024: $XXM borrow ÷ $XXM supply = 78% utilization
→ Strong capital efficiency signal for BD positioning

Chart 3: Top Borrowers
