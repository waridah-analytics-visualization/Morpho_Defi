Objective
 | Monitor lending flows and surface on-chain BD opportunities for modular DeFi lending protocols like Morpho. Track protocol health, asset utilization, and cohort retention to inform partnerships and incentive design.


Methodology
- Data Sources: Dune Analytics, DefiLlama, TokenTerminal, Morpho governance forums

- Analysis Stack: Python for data manipulation, screenshot-based dashboards for rapid iteration

- Metrics Tracked: TVL trends, borrow/supply ratios, user cohorts


Sample of Key Deliverables for Business Analyst at Morpho team:
- Daily BD Signals: High-value wallet movements and partnership opportunities

- Weekly Dashboard: Protocol health metrics (asset utilization, chain growth, incentive ROI)

- Deep-Dive Analysis: Vertical-specific opportunities (LSTs, stablecoins, RWAs)


Tools & Resources
- Data Collection 
 | Dune Analytics - On-chain SQL queries and dashboards

 | DefiLlama - Protocol TVL and competitive analysis

- Research Sources
 | Morpho Forum - Governance discussions

 | Morpho Blog - Partnership announcements

 | Dune Community Dashboards - User-generated analytics

- Notes on Methodology
 | Data Authenticity: All charts and metrics sourced from live protocols (Morpho, via Dune/DefiLlama). Cohort analysis demonstrates analytical framework—production version would require direct wallet tracking via Dune queries or Nansen integration. The aforementioned sample insights are examples and not sources from live protocols.

 | Timeframe: Analysis covers April 2024 - January 2026 period based on available dashboard data.

 | Scope: Single protocol (Morpho) deep-dive to demonstrate domain-specific expertise vs broad multi-protocol survey.


Sample Insights
   * Daily Signal Example (Jan 6, 2026) :
- Strong Utilization Rate Framework at 84.2%
  → Action: Outreach for depositor partnerships

- Gauntlet risk parameter discussions in governance
  → Insight: Anticipate market cap adjustments for BD planning
  
- Utilization Rate Framework
  → By overlaying borrow and supply trends across specific time periods, we calculate:
    → Utilization Rate = Cumulated Borrow USD / Cumulated Supply USD
      → NB: see [readme.md] file for Morpho's Utilization Rate as of [6th January 2026]


Why This Approach
- Global Regulatory Compliance fiat/crypto + Policy Advisory + AI Governance + AML/Adverse Media Investigator + Analyst/Researcher → On-Chain Business Analyst

- Regulatory and risk management lens: Identify institutional blockers (custody, compliance requirements, governance structure)

- Forensics background: Surface wallet relationships and flow patterns invisible in standard dashboards

|| My previous experience in fintech data analysis, payments/virtual assets compliance, policy advisory to governments and AI governance/safety reporting enables rigorous cadence for institutional DeFi partnerships.
