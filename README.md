# Objective
>Monitor lending flows and surface on-chain BD opportunities for modular DeFi lending protocols like Morpho. Track protocol health, asset utilization, and cohort retention to inform partnerships and incentive design.

# Daily, Weekly and Deep Dive analysis based on signals or query

##  Chart 1: TVL Over Time

> Screenshot: Morpho TVL chart (April 2024 - Jan 2026)[DefiLlama]
- Caption: Morpho Protocol Total Value Locked - 21-month trend showing protocol growth and capital inflows across 30 chains.
- Insight: TVL peaked at about 5.2B on [17th September 2025], indicating strong market support [Nasdaq Tokenization Proposal], institutional confidence across DEFI etc.
  > More specific to Morpho:major institutional integrations [Crypto .com and Société Générale’s digital asset subsidiary, SG Forge] to Morpho.

##  Chart 2: Borrow & Supply Trends (Utilization Rate Framework)
<img width="3058" height="1845" alt="cum-supply-borrow-USD-permarket-ethereum" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fe180e5f-98a0-473c-8c60-8c02b3bbd06c" />

- Screenshot: [Dune]
  > Top: Cumulated Supply USD per market
  > Bottom: Cumulated Borrow USD per market
- Caption: By overlaying borrow and supply trends across specific periods, we calculate utilization = borrow/supply to identify capital efficiency patterns
  → Specific period example : 6th January, 2026:
  > Utilization Rate = $1.6B ÷ $1.9B × 100
                 = 0.842 × 100
                 = 84.2%
  <img width="1330" height="502" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2076fe9f-8943-4370-9dfe-a170bc4df2be" />
  <img width="1303" height="488" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/63933eb7-6098-4397-9cc1-c1342226bbc4" />

- Insight: 84.2% utilization = Strong Capital Efficiency
>Good for lenders: Their deposits are earning yield (not sitting idle)
>Risk signal for borrowers: Limited capacity for new large borrows without adding more supply
>BD implication: Protocol is near capacity → prioritize supply-side partnerships (attract more depositors) to enable further borrow growth

##### Context Benchmarks:
> <50%: Underutilized (too much idle capital)

> 50-70%: Healthy range

> 70-85%: Strong efficiency (optimal)

>85%: Risk zone (liquidity crunch possible)

- Caption below image:Top 10 Borrowing Addresses - Priority targets for products and institutional partnerships.
- Insight: Top borrower Addresses with >$5M positions flagged for proactive BD outreach

##  Chart 4: Cohort Analysis

- Screenshot:User Cohort Activity: Weekly active addresses tracked to measure protocol stickiness and retention patterns.
- Caption:Cohort framework - production version tracks 30/60-day user growth per chain.
- Insight:User Growth by Chain: Cumulative user base and 7-day momentum by blockchain - identifies high-growth markets for targeted BD and incentive campaigns.
